The system today is based on the 2002 collective bargaining agreement. The MLB luxury tax was eliminated from 2000 to 2002, and MLB brought it back with a new change to the system.
Instead of putting a level between the 5th and 6th teams, they decided to set a threshold that a team could not pass without a fee.
Taxes are factored on each dollar going over the threshold.
2002 - 2011, first-time offenders would pay a fee of 17.5% of excess payrolls (later increased to 22.5%), second-time offenders would pay 30%, and third-time offenders would pay 40%.
2012 - 2015, after seeing teams go over more than three times, the agreement added a 50% taxation level when teams went over the limit four or more times.
(These offenses must be in consecutive years for these percentages. If a team falls below the threshold one year the penalty resets the next year to the "first offense")
